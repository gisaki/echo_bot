Set devicetree overlays

Devicetree overlays are explained in Introduction to devicetree. The CMake variable DTC_OVERLAY_FILE contains a space- or semicolon-separated list of overlay files to use. If DTC_OVERLAY_FILE specifies multiple files, they are included in that order by the C preprocessor. A file in a Zephyr module can be referred to by escaping the Zephyr module dir variable like \${ZEPHYR_<module>_MODULE_DIR}/<path-to>/dts.overlay when setting the DTC_OVERLAY_FILE variable.

You can set DTC_OVERLAY_FILE to contain exactly the files you want to use. Here is an example using west build.

If you don’t set DTC_OVERLAY_FILE, the build system will follow these steps, looking for files in your application configuration directory to use as devicetree overlays:

If the file boards/<BOARD>.overlay exists, it will be used.

If the current board has multiple revisions and boards/<BOARD>_<revision>.overlay exists, it will be used. This file will be used in addition to boards/<BOARD>.overlay if both exist.

If one or more files have been found in the previous steps, the build system stops looking and just uses those files.

Otherwise, if <BOARD>.overlay exists, it will be used, and the build system will stop looking for more files.

Otherwise, if app.overlay exists, it will be used.

All configuration files will be taken from the application’s configuration directory except for files with an absolute path that are given with the DTC_OVERLAY_FILE argument.

See Application Configuration Directory on how the application configuration directory is defined.

Using Shields will also add devicetree overlay files.

The DTC_OVERLAY_FILE value is stored in the CMake cache and used in successive builds.

The build system prints all the devicetree overlays it finds in the configuration phase, like this:

-- Found devicetree overlay: .../some/file.overlay

If the file boards/<BOARD>.overlay exists, it will be used.
に従って boards の下に overlay ファイルを格納したいが、Visual Studio Code の場合に認識されないようなので直下に nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp.overlay として格納している。
