Where bindings are located¶
Binding file names usually match their compatible: lines. For example, the above example binding would be named foo-company,bar-device.yaml by convention.

The build system looks for bindings in dts/bindings subdirectories of the following places:

the zephyr repository

your application source directory

your board directory

any shield directories

any directories manually included in the DTS_ROOT CMake variable

any module that defines a dts_root in its Build settings

The build system will consider any YAML file in any of these, including in any subdirectories, when matching nodes to bindings. A file is considered YAML if its name ends with .yaml or .yml.

Warning

The binding files must be located somewhere inside the dts/bindings subdirectory of the above places.

For example, if my-app is your application directory, then you must place application-specific bindings inside my-app/dts/bindings. So my-app/dts/bindings/serial/my-company,my-serial-port.yaml would be found, but my-app/my-company,my-serial-port.yaml would be ignored.
